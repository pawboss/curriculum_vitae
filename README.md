## Professional Profile
With over 20 years of experience in technology, my career spans from programming and development to systems administration and reliability engineering, allowing me to approach projects comprehensively and efficiently. I consider myself a versatile software engineer with expertise in PHP, Python, JavaScript, and Node.js.

I have a strong background in version control with Git and related tools, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. In databases, I am proficient with MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and specialize in REST and SOAP services, focusing on microservices architecture. My work also involves optimizing performance using Memcached, Redis, and CDNs like Akamai, Fastly, and Varnish.

I have extensive experience in continuous deployment, integrating GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, and managing infrastructure on AWS. Additionally, I have worked with monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and Instana to maintain system stability and efficiency.
